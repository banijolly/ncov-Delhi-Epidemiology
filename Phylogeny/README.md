Phylogenetic analysis was done following the protocol described by [Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.github.io/ncov/).
This repository contains the Nextstrain config and parameter files used to create the phylogenetic tree and the resulting tree files in Newick format. Due to GISAID's data sharing policy, FASTA sequence files have been replaced to contain only the sequence headers.

Code used to annotate and visualize the resulting tree can be found in the Rcode directory.
